                <p class="text-muted text-left">Get Vaccinated
Authorized COVID-19 vaccines can help protect you from COVID-19.
You should get a COVID-19 vaccine as soon as you can.
Once you are fully vaccinated, you may be able to start doing some things that you had stopped doing because of the pandemic.</p>

                <p class="text-muted text-left"> People who have a condition or are taking medications that weaken their immune system may not be fully protected even if they are fully vaccinated. They should continue to take all precautions recommended for unvaccinated people, including wearing a well-fitted mask, until advised otherwise by their healthcare provider.
If you are fully vaccinated, to maximize protection from the Delta variant and prevent possibly spreading it to others, wear a mask indoors in public if you are in an area of substantial or high transmission.
If you are fully vaccinated, see When You’ve Been Fully Vaccinated.
Wearing a mask over your nose and mouth is required on planes, buses, trains, and other forms of public transportation traveling into, within, or out of the United States and while indoors at U.S. transportation hubs such as airports and stations. Travelers are not required to wear a mask in outdoor areas of a conveyance (like on open deck areas of a ferry or the uncovered top deck of a bus).Stay 6 feet away from others
            Inside your home: Avoid close contact with people who are sick.
            If possible, maintain 6 feet between the person who is sick and other household members.
            Outside your home: Put 6 feet of distance between yourself and people who don’t live in your household.
            Remember that some people without symptoms may be able to spread virus.
            Stay at least 6 feet (about 2 arm lengths) from other people.
            Keeping distance from others is especially important for people who are at higher risk of getting very sick.</p>

                <p>COVID-19 is a respiratory condition caused by a coronavirus. Some people are infected but don’t notice any symptoms (doctors call that being asymptomatic). Most people will have mild symptoms and get better on their own. But some will have severe problems, such as trouble breathing. The odds of more serious symptoms are higher if you’re older or have another health condition like diabetes or heart disease.</p>
